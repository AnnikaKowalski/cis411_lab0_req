## 1. Overview
The problem we are facing is that when we order food we must go and pick it up. We have created an idea for allowing food to be delivered to buildings and room numbers. The image to the right shows the customer on the top left who is ordering food and getting it delivered. The customer has to long into the account first before they can order food. After logging in the can search food, order the food and make the payment. They can also check the status of the order once it is placed. The delivery person who is at the bottom right then receives the order and the information for the delivery of the order.
